Installer Translations
======================

This directory contains translations for Installer. This document
describes how to contribute to the effort of enhancing the language
coverage and maintaining translations.

This document was inspired in Git's l10n document.

Creating a new language translation
-----------------------------------

First of all you need to check if the language alreade exists, you
will see the following structure:

 po/_XX_/LC_MESSAGES/installer.[pm]o

where _XX_ is the language that you want to contribute to.

if the directory does not exist you need to create both directories,

 mkdir -p _XX_/LC_MESSAGES

and after that copy the installer.pot file located in po/ to LC_MESSAGES
with the name 'installer.po'

 cp po/installer.pot po/_XX_/LC_MESSAGES/installer.po

Once you are done with your translations, you need to generate the .mo
file for your language, this is done by using `msgfmt` program. Inside
your LC_MESSAGES directory, run the following command.

 msgfmt -o installer.mo installer.po

After that you should be able to test Installer in the desired new language
after re-installing the software:

 python setup.py install
 LANG=_XX_ installer --help


Contributing to an existing translation
---------------------------------------

If you find an already existing _XX_ directory or you are updating from a new
installer.pot file (when new versions are released), you need to do the
following procedure inside po/ directiory:

 msgmerge --add-location --backup=off -U _XX_/LC_MESSAGES/installer.po installer.pot

This will update the installer.po file inside your _XX_ language.


Generating the .pot file (only done by the coordinator)
-------------------------------------------------------

In order to create/update the new installer.pot file you need to be located
inside the main directory from the project, then use `xgettext` program:

 xgettext -f po/translatables -d installer -o po/installer.pot -L Python \
 --package-name=Installer --msgid-bugs-address=chrisadr@gentoo.org


Adding strings/files for translations
-------------------------------------

If you develop Installer, you need to mark all you translatable strings without
_("string") function. If you created a new file with translatable content, add
your file to the list translatables located in po/
