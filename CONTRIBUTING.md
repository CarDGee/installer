# Thank you for supporting installer
## Introduction

If you are reading this file, you already want to contribute to installer development,
so thank you, here we will explain you the best way to contribute to the project.

### Where to find information about how to develop?

Right now the source code will be the development from installer, take a look at the
code, try new things, send patches, suggest new ideas, any kind of help is always 
appreciated. You can reach me on IRC or send an email, or open an Issue in this repo.

### What can I contribute?

Since we are in the early development source from installer, any idea is good, we just
need to talk about it, and see if it can be done, besides that, the sky is the limit.

Just remember that installer needs to remain simple and light, we can't add runtime
dependencies that are not already present in stage3 tarballs or liveUSB ISOs.

#### Add support for your native language!

This is a very specific task that we need to accomplish before any 1.0 release, we
need to have as many translations as the official Gentoo Handbook has, so if you
know a language besides english, help is more than welcomed.

Refer to README inside the po/ directory to see how to create a translation for 
installer.

#### Test the installing procedure!

In this early stage, we need to test it as much as possible, the <beginner> command
is intended to be as easy to follow as possible, but if there is some lack of info 
that makes it hard for a newcomer, we need to work on that. Of course, adding more
verifications and validations is also great, as long as we follow the official 
Handbook installation guide.

### Where to send my patches?

You can send them directly to me, or open a Pull Request here, both ways work for me
right now.

### Where to report bugs?

As with patches, you can send them directly to my email or create an Issue here.

### Where to send ideas?

You probably know the answer to that at this point ;) 

### Coding style

You can see the code and try to follow the same syntax, if you don't agree about it,
you can even open it as an Issue and we can talk about better ways to do it.
