                            Step 3 - Installing Stage3
===============================================================================

Before to be able to download a stage3 tarball, you need to check wheter your
date and time is correct, not doing so could produce unexpected results or it
may be impossible to download it from a trusted mirror.

You can use `date` command to verify. Official Gentoo Installation media
includes `ntpd` command, which may help you in the syncronization. Using ntpd
requires that you send your IP adrress to the time server, if that's a problem
you can set it manually with the `date` command itself.

For more detailed info, please refer to:
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage

data to be able to build your system. Check the next URL for a mirror list:

Once you find the perfect mirror, you need to download a stage3 for your
specific architecture. Usually you'll find a URL like:

protocol://mirror/releases/amd64/autobuilds/stage3_dir/stage3*.{bz2|xz}

Move to /mnt/gentoo and use one of the following commands:
    wget <URL>
    links <URL> and choose the tarball in the cli-browser

Remember to download .DIGEST or .DIGEST.asc if you want to verify and validate
the stage3 tarball.

More information about validation and verification please refer to:
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage#Verifying_and_validating

unpack_msg="""\
Now that stage3 is located in /mnt/gentoo you can unpack the contents. Please
use the exact command:

    tar xpf stage3-*.tar.{bz2,xz} --xattrs-include='*.*' --numeric-owner
