                         Step 10 - Configuring the system
================================================================================
We are almost there, now you need to set the root password, execute:

    passwd

After that you may want to set your host name, you'll need to refer to your init
system's documentation, some examples include:

    nano -w /etc/conf.d/hostname    (OpenRC)
    hostnamectl COMMAND             (SystemD)

This is a good moment to download all the required or desired software that does
not come with the base stage3 tarball, specially networking related software:

    emerge --ask net-misc/networkmanager
    emerge --ask net-misc/dhcpcd
    emerge --ask net-wireless/iw net-wireless/wpa_supplicant

If you need more detailed info, refer to:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Full/Networking
"""

logger_msg="""\
If you are not using systemd as your init system, you need to install a logger:
(You only need ONE from these)
 
    emerge --ask app-admin/sysklogd (recommended for beginners)
    emerge --ask app-admin/syslog-ng
    emerge --ask app-admin/metalog

You may want to read the next section for other optional tools:
