                                Welcome to stager!
===============================================================================
Before begin we need to make sure that you reach www.gentoo.org to be able to
download stage3 tarball. You can check with: 

    ping -c 2 www.gentoo.org

Otherwhise I can try to do it for you. Please type one of these options:
