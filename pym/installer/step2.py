                         Step 2 - Preparing the disks
===============================================================================

Now we are going to prepare your block device and make a partition table to be
able to store your filesystems, you have two options:

    MBR (Master Boot Record), you'll need to use fdisk.
    GPT (GUID Partition Table), you'll need to use parted.

Althought this prototype is not designed to generate a partition table, you may
find interesting the next suggestion:

    - You must have a root (/) partition.
    - You'll probably like a /boot partition.
    - You may want a swap partition.
    - You may want a separate /home partition.

For more detailed info, please refer to:
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Disks
""")

post_partition_msg=_("""\
Now that you have a partition table, you need to create a filesystem on each
partition to be able to store data. This prototype assumes that you'll create
ext4 filesystems, some useful commands include:

    mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdXy
where:
    -X is the device letter
    -y is the partition number

To be able to create a swap partition, you can use:

    mkswap /dev/sdXy
    swapon /dev/sdXy

For more detailed info please refer to:
https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Disks#Creating_file_systems
""")

mounting_root_msg=_("""\
Finally, we need you to mount your root partition (/) into /mnt/gentoo. If you
don't have a /mnt/gentoo directory, you can create one with:

    mkdir -p /mnt/gentoo

Then you need to mount it with:

    mount /dev/sdXy /mnt/gentoo
