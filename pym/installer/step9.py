                         Step 9 - Configuring the kernel
================================================================================
Configuring the kernel is one of the most important tasks during installation,
since you are in the beginner section, we highly recommend you to install
genkernel-next. If you want or need to do it manually, please refer to:

https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Kernel

First of all, download Gentoo's kernel and if you need special drivers (e.g. an
extra driver for a wifi card) download linux-firmware too.

    emerge --ask sys-kernel/gentoo-sources sys-kernel/linux-firmware

After that, emerge genkernel-next:

    emerge --ask sys-kernel/genkernel-next

Exit the shell for the next message.
"""

fstab_msg="""\
Before to begin kernel configuration and installation, you need to edit your
/etc/fstab file because genkernel will read it to place initramfs in /boot
partition. This is a good time to leave your /etc/fstab file ready.

    nano -w /etc/fstab

You have to write all your partitions as stated in /etc/fstab itself, once you
are finish, save your changes and execute:

    genkernel --menuconfig all

This will prompt a interactive menu where you have to enable your desired
options, usually default is ok, but if you need some extra info, or you want to
use systemd, these links may help you:
