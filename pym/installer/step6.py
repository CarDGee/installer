                            Step 6 - Entering the chroot
================================================================================
Congratulations!! Your are about to enter into your brand new Gentoo system.
Please keep in mind that you need to have /mnt/gentoo mounted and /proc /sys
/dev linked (step 5) and most likely if something goes wrong, you can resume
from here (in most cases and if you don't need to change your partition table
or filesystems and still have internet connection).

The first command will be executed, after that you'll need to execute:

    chroot /mnt/gentoo /bin/bash #DO NOT USE THIS
    source /etc/profile          #(this will set all the ENV variables)
    export PS1="(chroot) $PS1"   #(this will help you to recognize the terminal)

If you created some extra partitions like home or boot, mount them: 

    mkdir /{boot,home}
    mount /dev/sdXy /{boot,home}

Finally, run `installer beginner -s 7` to continue with the installation.
