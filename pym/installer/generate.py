================================================================================
I'll prepare a stageX tarball, after extracting a regular stage3 tarball during
installation, you can extract stageX tarball and you'll have most of the files
needed to finish installation, some of these files include:

    /etc/portage/* : All the required files and subdirectories.
    /var/lib/portage/world : List of currently installed programs.
    /etc/timezone : Current timezone
    /etc/locale.gen : Current locales

Once you extract stageX tarball you'll still need to:

    Update your repository (emerge-webrsync)
    Update @world
    Configure timezone and locales
    Update your /etc/fstab file
    Configure your kenrel.
    Configure your bootloader.
